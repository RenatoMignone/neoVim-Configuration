# NeoVim Configuration

This repository contains my custom **NeoVim** configuration, set up using **Lua** to enhance my workflow. The configuration includes various plugins, settings, key mappings, and utilities aimed at improving efficiency, performance, and usability for coding and editing.

## Repository Structure

The configuration files are organized into the following structure:

- **`init.lua`**  
  The main entry point for the configuration. It initializes the setup by sourcing essential Lua scripts and configuring core settings.

- **`lua/`**  
  This directory contains all the core configuration files organized in Lua modules.
  - **`core/`**: Contains the core settings for NeoVim, such as default configuration, utility functions, and key mappings.
  - **`plugins/`**: Contains configuration for various plugins used in the setup. Each plugin has its own configuration file inside the `configs` directory.
